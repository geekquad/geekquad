# Open-Source Projects

## [AlgoBook](https://github.com/geekquad/AlgoBook)

The goal of this project is to help the beginners with their contributions in Open Source and bring all possible Data Structures & Algorithms in various programming languages under one roof. We aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute in any way you want, just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines.

I'm looking for a maintainer with sound knowledge of DSA to keep an eye on new contributors and ensure quality contributions. Feel free to reach out!

## [Image-Processing-OpenCV](https://github.com/geekquad/Image-Processing-OpenCV)

This repository is focused on having various feature implementation of OpenCV in Python. It aims to offer a single, unified platform for anyone who want to study and practice Image Processing.

Future prospectus is to create a WebApp in which a user can easily integrate his Image Processing Algorithm and take away learnings from it right away. I'm looking for a maintainer with Web Development experience to keep an eye on new contributors and ensure quality contributions. Feel free to reach out!

## [Algo-ScriptML](https://github.com/Algo-Phantoms/Algo-ScriptML)

Scripts of Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch. Implementations of machine learning models and algorithms using nothing but NumPy with a focus on accessibility. Aims to cover everything from basic to advance. The goal of this project is not to create algorithms that are as streamlined and computationally efficient as possible, but rather to present their inner workings in a clear and usable manner.

It is being actively maintained and governed under [Algo Phantoms](https://github.com/Algo-Phantoms), with new contributors trying to assist us achieve our objective.
